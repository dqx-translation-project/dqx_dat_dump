# dqx_dat_dump

This repository houses a number of tooling scripts used to support the modification of the game's `data00000000.win32.dat0` and `data00000000.win32.idx` file for translation purposes. With the usage of these scripts, this generates a modified DAT that has packed translation text.

Review the `README.md` in each directory to see what the tools do.
